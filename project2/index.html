Many would guess that gaming is something for young teens who will eventually grow out of gaming. Although this isn't the case at all. Gamers below the age of 18 actually make 21% of the playerbase which puts them in third place behind gamers age 34 to 54 years, who make up 26% and gamers who are age 18 to 34, which make up the biggest chunk at 38%. </p>
