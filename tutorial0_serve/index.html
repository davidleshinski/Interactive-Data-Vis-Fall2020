    <H1>Welcome to Interactive Data Visualization Tutorials!</H1>
    <p>Interactive Data Visualization is one of the most important forms of communication today â€” allowing users to better engage with data, detect patterns, and quickly gain insight into complicated topics. This course will introduce students to the tools, skills, and concepts necessary for making state-of-the-art interactive data visualizations. Using web-based technologies including HTML, CSS, and D3.js, students will learn to create engaging and effective information displays, grounded in the science of visual perception and best practices in visual mapping and accessibility. Throughout the semester, students will work towards creating a portfolio of beautiful and analytically sound data visualizations, while also developing their own iterative design process.</p>
